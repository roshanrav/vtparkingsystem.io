      <section class="project-description">
        <p>Virginia Tech serves a large community of over 38,000 students and more than 2,500 faculty members. Managing parking efficiently in such a large community is crucial for campus accessibility. Currently, the existing mobile parking app, ParkMobile, has limitations, including not providing real-time information on parking spot availability and allowing users to reserve parking spaces in advance. This limitation can cause inconvenience for students, faculty, staff, and visitors to campus resources.</p>
        
        <p>Our proposed parking system will go beyond the limitations of ParkMobile by providing a more comprehensive and tailored parking solution for the Virginia Tech campus. Our Hokie Parking System not only enhances the parking experience but also supports Virginia Techâ€™s commitment to providing an efficient, user-centered campus environment.</p>
