                <h4>Emma's Scenario</h4>
                <p>Emma is a 20-year-old sophomore student at Virginia Tech who lives off campus and needs to commute to campus daily for classes. Her classes are mostly in the morning and early afternoon, which is peak parking time. Because of this, Emma often struggles to find a parking spot when she arrives at campus. Currently, she must drive around campus looking for an available space, which sometimes makes her late to class or even to exams.</p>
                <p>With the Hokie Parking System, Emma can check real-time parking availability through the mobile app before leaving home. Once she finds a spot close to her classroom building, she reserves it in advance, ensuring she has a space when she arrives. Emma also makes use of the option to pay using her credit card directly through the app.</p>

                <h4>Trevor's Scenario</h4>
                <p>Trevor is a member of the Virginia Tech Parking Services Administration team. His primary responsibilities include managing campus parking operations and addressing any complaints from drivers. Currently, Trevor must rely on reports from patrolling staff or calls from drivers unable to find a spot to monitor parking lots. Without real time data, the current solution is inefficient and will lead to user dissatisfaction. </p>
                <p> With the Hokie Parking System, Trevor has access to a dashboard that provides real-time data on parking availability across campus. By the end of each week, he is able to view a summary of parking usage trends, including occupancy rates for each lot and peak parking times.  With these summaries, Trevor can make data-driven adjustments to campus parking, therefore increasing parking experience for all users. </p>
