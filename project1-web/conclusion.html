            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="text">
              The Hokie Parking System represents an innovative approach to parking management, addressing the limitations of existing solutions and enhancing the parking experience for Virginia Tech’s large and diverse community. By leveraging a modular design that includes real-time data processing, reservation capabilities, and comprehensive analytics, the system meets the specific needs of students, faculty, staff, and campus visitors, while also supporting the operational efficiency of the Parking Services administration team. The usage of this new design aligns with the Virginia Tech’s shift towards having a more technologically advanced campus, enabling those on campus to interact with parking in an efficient and data-driven manner that has never been previously possible.
